 **Project Overview******
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to classifying iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the popular Iris dataset, a Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict the species based on four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, showcasing the effectiveness of ensemble methods in classification tasks.

** 1. Problem Statement**
The task is to build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of the three species using their sepal and petal measurements. The primary objective is to:

Train a model with high accuracy.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using standard metrics.
Save the trained model for future use.

** 2. Dataset Information**

Total Samples: 150
Features: 4 numeric features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
Classes: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Class Distribution:

Setosa: 50 samples
